## Site Agenda
Yelp! aims to connect users with restaurants and other businesses in their area. The platform provides the location of a business along with images, links, and reviews about the establishment.
This site speaks to me as it is now one of the most downloaded apps in the app store, and it is one that my family and I constantly use. My father is especially reliant on Yelp. Before visiting any new restaurant or business, he will check its location and review on Yelp to make sure that he trusts it.
## How does Yelp work?
Yelp allows users to specify filters or searches through which they can find related businesses within a specified area. Once located, businesses are recommended to the user upon basis of popularity and proximity. The review feature allows users to compare establishments and feel secure in their choice of business or restaurant.
## Technologies
Yelp utilizes Google Maps as its mapping interface. This allows for a wide variety of businesses to be integrated with the service, as many businesses are already registered within the Google Maps database.
## Changes
If I could change one thing about Yelp, it would be indicators of the business and time to travel to each location. The service does a great job of recommending businesses and displaying reviews, but does not have much live data showing the current state of the businesses or the paths to them.
