## Thinking Cap Assignment

### What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"

Thick mapping in the digital humanities takes a more holistic approach to mapping than classical maps. Thick mapping views a location, not as a simple set of coordinates, but as a venue for life. Each location on a map has millennia of history that has been created through countless people. This history is constantly expanding, and the continuing documentation of events contributes to expanding the history that thick maps hold. The "thickness" of a map is dependent on the variety and breadth of the information that can be found on the map. Contrary to other informative maps, thick maps aim to present a multitude of viewpoints to the user. 

### How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?

Thick mapping offers an alternative approach to mapping that emphasizes a variety of perspectives to be represented within the map. This approach is quite contrary to the typical style of mapping utilized when presenting digital maps. When creating a website, there is generally a lens or purpose that is behind the creation of the map or website. Whether this motive is financial, political, or social, there is usually only one argument or viewpoint being promoted. On the other hand, thick mapping advocates for the promotion of multiple perspectives that mesh together to create a full image of the cultural landscape of each location.
